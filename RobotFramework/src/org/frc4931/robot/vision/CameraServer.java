/**
 * Encapsulates an Motion JPEG (M-JPEG) server that sends images to the Smart Dashboard. To receive images on the Smart Dashboard,
 * choose \"USB Camera HW\" on the dashboard.
 * <p>
 * The server must be {@link #startServer() started} when desired and can be {@link #stopServer() stopped}, although most of the
 * time robot code will not want to stop and restart the server. Instead, generally the server will be started at the beginning of
 * autonomous or teleoperated mode and will run until the end of the match.
 * <p>
 * There are two ways of providing images to the server, but these work only when the server is running. The first is manually
 * adding images via the {@link #sendImage(Image)}; this is useful for sending modified or annotated images collected from the
 * NIVisiion code (usually via our {@link Camera} or the standard {@link USBCamera}).
 * <p>
 * The second approach is to have this server {@link #startAutomaticCapture(Camera) automatically capture images} from a given
 * camera at the frame rate desired by the Smart Dashboard client. The specified camera can even be a {@link CompositeCamera},
 * which allows the robot code to automatically send images from one of several different named cameras and at any time to switch
 * between those cameras.
 * <p>
 * <h2>How this works</h2>
 * This class uses a single {@link BlockingDeque blocking double ended queue} (or "deque") to pass images between the
 * automatic capture thread (or manually sent images) and the server thread. This deque is threadsafe, and it allows eah
 * thread to efficiently block when the other is not running. For example, only when the server thread is started will
 * a small number of image buffers be added to the deque. Automatically capturing images will repeatedly remove a buffer
 * from the queue, populate it from the camera, and put it back into the queue. Then, the server thread will repeatedly
 * remove a (presumably filled buffer) from the same queue, send it to the client, and put the buffer back into the queue.
 * <p>
 * The number of buffers in the queue is an important part of this mechanism. It must be small enough not to cause a noticeable
 * lag in the image stream. On the other hand, if there are too few buffers then the server and capture threads will end up
 * waiting for each other. Currently, this class uses 3 buffers.
 * <p>
 * The capture thread attempts to capture images at approximately the same frame rate as specified by the Smart Dashboard
 * client. However, it is possible to capture at a slightly higher rate without any adverse affect. For example, if the
 * capture thread is operating significantly faster, then it might actually (re)populate all of the buffers in the deque
 * before the server thread has a chance to send even one. This is perfectly acceptable, since the server will always attempt
 * to send the image in the buffer at the front of the deque. A higher capture rate simply requires more CPU on
 * the robot without any tangible benefit for sending images to the client.
